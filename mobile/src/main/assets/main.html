<h1><b>Thank you for using TawaafOnWear</b></h1>
<br/><br/>
This app was developed to be as simple as possible lest it become a distraction to your worship.
<br/><br/>
Therefore, please NOT use this application if it, or your Wear device does become a distraction.
<br/>
Preferably, turn off your phone or Bluetooth, so that other notifications stop.
Start your tawaaf by making a clear, sincere intention. Recite the takbeer at the Hajre-Aswad (Black stone)
and proceed to do your 1st round, constantly in connection with your Creator.
When you reach the Hajre-aswad again, tap your phone to record the round.
Repeat until the end of the 7th round, after which the counter will reset and the tawaaf count will increment.
<br/><br/>
Please remember me in your duahs.
<br/><br/>
